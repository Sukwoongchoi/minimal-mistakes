  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <blockquote>Firms increasingly utilize AI to assist or replace human tasks. However, AI can also train humans and make them better. We study how the AI’s instructional role improves human decision-making in the professional Go games where an AI-powered Go program (APG) unexpectedly surpassed the best human player, surpassing the best human knowledge and skill accumulated over thousands of years. To isolate the learning-from-AI effect, we compare the quality of human moves to that of AI’s superior solutions, before and after the initial public release of an APG. Our analysis of 750,990 moves in 25,033 games suggests that APG’s training significantly improved the players’ move quality—reducing the number of errors and the magnitude of the most critical mistake. The improvement is most prominent in the early stage of a game when uncertainty is higher. Further, younger players benefit more than older players, suggesting generational inequality in learning from AI.</blockquote>

+ **It Ain’t Over ‘Til It’s Over: Post-IPO VC Ownership Effect on Innovation-Enhancing Investment of Newly Public Firms** (with T. Kim and H. Woo)  
*Revise and Resubmit*, 2022.
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <blockquote>Although the existing literature has discussed the effects of VC firms on investee ventures before and at the time of an IPO, less is known about how they influence the strategic decisions of newly public firms after the IPO. Conventional wisdom is that VC investors exit from a venture investment through an IPO. However, we find that VC investors hold a significant amount of shares for years after an IPO. This study examines how VC investors affect a firm after an IPO. Building on the literature on governance through ownership, we argue that post-IPO VC shareholders encourage innovation-enhancing investments of newly public firms and that post-IPO VC ownership positively affects the market value of newly public firms. Our underlying logic is that outcomes created by innovation-enhancing investments of newly public firms can be beneficial to not only themselves but also VC shareholders for VC reputation, network externality, and knowledge acquisition. Consistent with our arguments, our empirical study shows that post-IPO VC ownership is positively related to R&D intensity, CAPEX investment, and Tobin’s Q of newly public firms and that these relationships are amplified when a lead VC is located close to the firm, when a VC investor sits on the board, and when investees are in technology-intensive industries. This study expands the scope of the VC effect on investee ventures beyond an IPO.</blockquote>

+ **Stay the Course? The Effects of Government Matching R&D Funding on Tech Startups** (with Y. Lee, T. Kim, and W. Kim)  
  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <blockquote>This study examines the effectiveness of a government-matched R&D subsidy program for startups, which leverages the selection capabilities of private venture capital firms in awarding funds. Using a regression discontinuity design and a combination of confidential and hand-collected data, we assess the program's impact on follow-up investments, R&D investment, and patenting activities in funded startups. Our findings reveal that startups benefiting from the matching R&D subsidy program secure more subsequent investments (3.3 times), R&D investment (14.1%), and patenting activities (13.7%) compared to non-funded peers, highlighting the potential of government-matched R&D funding programs that engage private sector expertise in the selection process to drive growth and innovation. Through a survey of awardees and non-awardees, we identify underlying mechanisms, including that funded startups were more likely to adhere to their business models and strategic planning, adopt new technologies, and implement performance-based human resource management practices. These insights can inform policymaking on strategies to foster innovation in the startup ecosystem.</blockquote>
