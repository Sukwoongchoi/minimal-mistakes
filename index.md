## Hello! &#128075;
I am Sukwoong Choi, a postdoctoral scholar at the MIT Sloan School of Management and CSAIL (Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory). 
+ My research interests are innovation and entrepreneurship. I am also interested in the economics of AI, especially how AI affects human decision-making, corporate R&D, firm productivity, and labor markets.
+ Before joining the MIT Sloan, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Southern California (Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship) and the University of Kentucky (Gatton College of Business and Economics, Management).
+ I received my PhD from KAIST College of Business. During my PhD, I was a visiting PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley (Haas School of Business, Management of Organizations (MORS)) and Northwestern University (Kellogg School of Management, MORS and NICO (Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems)).
