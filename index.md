## Hello <span class="waving-hand">ðŸ‘‹</span> 
I am Sukwoong Choi, a postdoctoral scholar at the MIT Sloan Schoolâ€™s Initiative on the Digital Economy and MIT CSAIL. 
+ My research interests are innovation and entrepreneurship. I am also interested in the economics of AI, especially how AI affects human decision-making, human knowledge, corporate R&D, and labor markets.
+ Before joining the MIT Sloan, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Southern California (Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship) and the University of Kentucky (Gatton College of Business and Economics, Management). 
+ I received my PhD from KAIST College of Business. During my PhD, I was a visiting PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley (Haas School of Business, MORS) and Northwestern University (Kellogg School of Management, MORS, and NICO).
