## Hello &#128075;
I am Sukwoong Choi, an Assistant Professor at the Dept. of Information Systems and Business Analytics, Massry School of Business in the University at Albany of State University of New York (SUNY). I am also a Digital Fellow at Initiative on the Digital Economy (IDE) of MIT. 

+ My research interests are innovation and entrepreneurship driven by disruptive technologies such as AI, Quantum Computing, and Algorithms. I am also interested in the economics of AI, especially how AI affects human decision-making, corporate R&D, firm productivity, and labor markets.

+ Before joining the University at Albany, I was a postdoctoral scholar at MIT Sloan and MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), the University of Southern California (Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship), and the University of Kentucky (Gatton College of Business and Economics, Management).
  
+ I received my PhD from KAIST College of Business. During my PhD, I was a visiting PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley (Haas School of Business, Management of Organizations (MORS)) and Northwestern University (Kellogg School of Management, MORS and NICO (Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems)).
