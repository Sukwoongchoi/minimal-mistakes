## Hello! &#128075;
I am Sukwoong Choi, a postdoctoral scholar at the MIT Sloan Schoolâ€™s Initiative on the Digital Economy and MIT CSAIL. 
+ My research interests are innovation and entrepreneurship. I am also interested in the economics of AI, especially how AI affects human decision-making, corporate R&D, firm productivity, and labor markets.
+ I am on the market this year (2022-2023).
